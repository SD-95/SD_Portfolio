                                A passionate developer and aspiring data scientist with a unique journey from a non-IT background to becoming a hybrid tech professional. I specialize in crafting intelligent, data-driven web applications that bridge the gap between machine learning and modern frontend design.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My journey has been anything but conventional — after starting in facilities management, I transitioned into tech, mastering React.js for building dynamic interfaces and Python/Flask for backend logic. Today, I combine my skills in AI and software development to build tools that not only work but solve real-world problems.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                From predictive modeling to real-time data visualization, I believe in creating digital experiences that are as insightful as they are intuitive. Whether it's predicting cryptocurrency liquidity or developing full-stack blogging platforms, I'm driven by innovation, clean code, and a user-first mindset.
                            </p>
